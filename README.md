# 🧠 Personality Prediction: Extrovert vs Introvert

This project classifies a person's personality type (extrovert or introvert) based on their responses to a set of behavioral and psychological features using machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset
- Self-reported questionnaire-based dataset (Open Source)
- Features: Openness, Energy Level, Social Activity, Emotional Stability, etc.
- Target: Personality Type (Extrovert/Introvert)

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Label Encoding
3. Model Training & Comparison
4. Visualization of Results
5. Insights and Recommendations

## 🎯 Results
- Best Accuracy: **84%** (Decision Tree)
- ROC-AUC Score: 0.81

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🔍 Insights
- Emotional Stability and Energy Level were key predictors.
- Simple models like Decision Trees gave surprisingly good results.

## 💡 Future Work
- Collect larger, diverse data samples.
- Turn into a web-based personality test using Streamlit.
